Thaw a tube of NEB 10-beta Competent E. coli cells on ice until the last ice crystals disappear. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 ¶Ãl of cells into a transformation tube on ice.
Add 1-5 ¶Ãl containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 2 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°„C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 2 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 950 ¶Ãl of room temperature SOC into the mixture. Immediately spread 50-100 ¶Ãl onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at 37-42°„C. NOTE: Selection using antibiotics other than ampicillin may require some outgrowth before plating on selective media. Colonies develop faster at temperatures above 37°„C, however some constructs may be unstable at elevated temperatures.
